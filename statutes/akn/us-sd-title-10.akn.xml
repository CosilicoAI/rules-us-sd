Upon the filing of reassessment lists pursuant to §

, the secretary of revenue shall examine, equalize, and correct the reassessment so as to conform substantially with the assessment of like property throughout the state. The secretary shall transmit to the county auditor of the county in which the reassessment was made one corrected and equalized copy of the reassessment. The reassessment list for all purposes supersedes the original assessment for the year upon the property. Upon receipt of the reassessment list, the county auditor shall extend and levy the taxes on the reassessed property for the year according to the reassessment, in the same manner as though the list were the original list of the property. However, nothing in the reassessment proceedings prevents any person feeling aggrieved by the reassessment proceedings from appealing to the secretary of revenue.

Limitation on tax levy increase on real property--School districts excepted.
This section does not apply to school districts. The total amount of revenue payable from taxes on real property within a taxing district, excluding the levy pursuant to §
10-13-36
, may increase no more than the lesser of three percent or the index factor, as defined in §
10-13-38
, over the amount of revenue payable from taxes on real property in the preceding year, excluding the amount of taxes levied pursuant to §
10-13-36
.
After applying the index factor, a taxing district may increase the revenue payable from taxes on real property above the limitations provided by this section by the percentage increase of value resulting from any improvements or change in use of real property, annexation, minor boundary changes, and any adjustments in taxation of property separately classified and subject to statutory adjustments and reductions under chapters
10-4
,
10-6
,
10-6A
, and
10-6B
, except §
10-6-113
, only if assessed the same as property of equal value. For taxes payable in 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, and 2031, an increase in revenue payable to a taxing district allowed under this paragraph may not exceed three percent.
A taxing district may increase the revenue it receives from taxes on real property above the limit provided by this section for taxes levied to pay the principal, interest, and redemption charges on any bonds which are subject to referendum, scheduled payment increases on bonds, for a levy directed by the order of a court for the purpose of paying a judgment against the taxing district, upon the termination of a tax increment financing district pursuant to §
11-9-46
, or upon the application of any discretionary formula to real property pursuant to §
10-6-137
. Any taxing district created after the effective date of this section is exempt from the limitation provided by this section for a period of two years immediately following its creation.
For purposes of this section, an increase in value resulting from an improvement made to an owner-occupied single-family dwelling does not include additions to, or improvements of, existing structures affixed to land that result in an increase in value of forty percent or less to the owner-occupied single-family dwelling.

Ownership requirements for classifying dwellings as owner-occupied.
For the purposes of §§
10-13-39
and
10-13-40
, an owner shall be the owner of the owner-occupied dwelling as recorded by the director of equalization in the county where the dwelling is located. A joint tenant, an owner of a life estate, a partner, a person owning an interest in a limited liability company, a person owning an interest in a corporation, a vendee of a contract for deed, or a beneficiary of a trust is considered to be an owner.
An owner may claim a credit only on the single-family dwelling used as a principal residence. An owner may have more than one parcel of land classified as owner-occupied if the additional parcel is contiguous to the parcel containing the owner-occupied house. Each parcel that is contiguous, under the same ownership and used as one property shall be considered as owner-occupied. A property is also considered contiguous if separated by a street or alley from the parcel containing the owner-occupied house.
If the dwelling is occupied by a parent of the owner, the parent is considered the owner and occupant of the single-family dwelling. If the dwelling is occupied by an adult with a disability, and the parent of the adult with a disability is the owner, the adult with a disability is considered the owner and occupant of the single-family dwelling.
The owner or a legal representative of the owner may sign for signature purposes on the certification of an owner-occupied dwelling. For the purposes of this Act, adult with a disability, means any person who receives or is qualified to receive monetary payments, pursuant to Title II, X, XIV, or XVI of the Social Security Act, as amended to January 1, 2008.

Eligibility for owner-occupied classification.
To be eligible for a property classification pursuant to §
10-13-39
, the owner of each owner-occupied dwelling, as defined in §
10-13-39
, shall submit a certificate to the county director of equalization stating such person is the owner and occupant of the dwelling as of the assessment date pursuant to §
10-6-105
and that the dwelling is the owner's principal place of residence as defined in §
12-1-4
. If the owner occupies two or more dwellings during an assessment year, the owner shall provide the location of any other dwellings that the owner occupies when submitting the certificate. The director of equalization may request additional documentation from the owner when making the determination of eligibility. If any person submits information to the director of equalization contesting the eligibility of a dwelling to be classified as an owner-occupied single-family dwelling, the director of equalization shall review the classification and make a determination of eligibility. The owner shall state on the certificate the portion of the dwelling so occupied by the owner if it is less than fifty percent of the dwelling or if the dwelling is a duplex, triplex, or fourplex. The owner-occupant shall submit the certificate by March fifteenth. The owner of each manufactured or mobile home as defined in §
32-3-1
, shall submit a certificate to the county director of equalization stating such person is the owner and occupant of the dwelling as of the assessment date. The owner-occupant of each manufactured or mobile home shall submit the certificate during the time of registration pursuant to §§
10-9-3
to
10-9-4
, inclusive. If the owner-occupant of a manufactured or mobile home fails to submit the certificate by the date or time frame required pursuant to §§
10-9-3
to
10-9-4
, inclusive, it does not affect the eligibility of the property to be classified as an owner-occupied dwelling. The owner-occupant shall sign the certificate under penalty of perjury. If the director of equalization classifies the property, mobile home, or manufactured home as owner-occupied single-family dwelling, it shall retain the classification until such time as the property ownership is transferred or the property has a change in use. The new owner-occupant of transferred property which is already classified as owner-occupied may meet the requirements of this section by completing and filing the certificate of value required pursuant to §
7-9-7
at the time of the transfer of the property. If the legal description of property is changed or amended and the owner continues to reside in the dwelling that is classified as a owner-occupied single-family dwelling, the owner shall retain the owner-occupied single-family dwelling classification. The Department of Revenue shall prescribe the form of the certificate and the certificate of value required pursuant to §
7-9-7
. Appeals regarding the owner-occupied classification shall be made directly to the county board of equalization pursuant to §
10-11-23
.

Exemption for coal-fired power plant performing environmental upgrade--Allocation of exemption.
The first year after the environmental upgrade is operational, the original cost of the environmental upgrade, as reported to the agency regulating the coal-fired power plant, is exempt from ad valorem taxation. In the second and subsequent years after the environmental upgrade is operational, the depreciated cost of the environmental upgrade, as reported to the agency regulating the coal-fired power plant, is exempt from ad valorem taxation. Any value that is attributable to the construction work in progress on the environmental upgrade shall be excluded from the assessment process of the owner or owners of the coal fired power plant.
This exemption shall be allocated proportionately, based upon percentage ownership of the coal-fired power plant. However, no coal-fired power plant may have its assessed valuation reduced below its valuation for the year preceding the first year the environmental upgrade is operational.

Renewable energy facilities with less than five megawatts of nameplate capacity classified--Property taxable--Exemption.
For renewable energy facilities with less than five megawatts of nameplate capacity, all real property used or constructed for the purpose of producing electricity using a renewable resource as an energy source is classified for tax purposes as renewable energy property and shall be assessed and taxed in the same manner as other real property and shall be locally assessed by the county director of equalization pursuant to §
10-3-16
. For the purposes of §§
10-4-42
to
10-4-45
, inclusive, the first fifty thousand dollars of the assessed value of the renewable energy property or seventy percent of the assessed value of the renewable energy property, whichever is greater, is exempt from the real property tax. However, for geothermal renewable energy facilities that produce energy, but not electricity, this exemption is limited to the first four continuous years for residential geothermal renewable energy facilities and the first three continuous years for commercial geothermal renewable energy facilities.

De minimis defined.
For the purposes of §
10-45-1.12
, the term, de minimis, means the retailer's purchase price or gross receipts of the taxable products is ten percent or less of the total purchase price or gross receipts of the bundled products. A retailer shall use either the purchase price or the gross receipts of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. No retailer may use a combination of the purchase price and gross receipts of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. A retailer shall use the full term of a service contract to determine if the taxable products are de minimis.

In determining the amount of tax due under this chapter, a person licensed pursuant to chapter

and a person licensed pursuant to chapter
36-20B
may deduct from gross receipts amounts which represent charges to clients for tangible personal property, any product transferred electronically, or services purchased by the attorney or accountant on behalf of a client. However, the sale of the property or service to the attorney or accountant is not a sale for resale if this deduction is taken. This deduction may only be taken if the amount to be deducted represents an expense specifically incurred for a particular client and the amount is itemized and separately billed as a reimbursable expense by the attorney or accountant.

Bad debts--Deduction from amount upon which tax is calculated--Return deduction allowed--Credit or refund.
For purposes of this chapter, a bad debt means the same as the term is defined at 26 U.S.C. § 166 as of January 1, 2005, and is any portion of the purchase price of a transaction that a seller has reported as taxable and for which the seller or any party related to the seller within the meaning of section 267 or 707 of the Internal Revenue Code (related party), as of January 1, 2003, or any disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes that is owned by the seller or a related party, has written off as uncollectible for federal income tax purposes. In computing the amount of tax due, a seller may deduct bad debts from the total amount upon which the tax is calculated for any return. Any deduction taken or refund paid which is attributed to bad debts may not include interest. Bad debts include worthless checks, worthless credit card payments, and uncollectible credit accounts. Bad debts do not include financing charges or interest, sales or use taxes charged on the purchase price, uncollectible amounts on property that remain in the possession of the seller until the full purchase price is paid, expenses incurred in attempting to collect any debt, debts sold, or assigned to unrelated third parties for collection, and repossessed property. No bad debt deduction may be claimed by any person that has purchased accounts receivable for collection unless the person is a successor that has acquired the entire business of the seller that incurred the bad debt, the person is a related party, or the person is a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes that is owned by the seller or a related party.
A bad debt may be deducted on the return for the period during which the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and records and is eligible to be deducted for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of this section, a claimant who is not required to file federal income tax returns may deduct a bad debt on a return filed for the period in which the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the claimant's books and records and would be eligible for a bad debt deduction for federal income tax purposes if the claimant was required to file a federal income tax return. If a deduction is taken for a bad debt and the seller subsequently collects the debt in whole or in part, the tax on the amount so collected shall be paid and reported on the next return due after the collection. A seller may allocate its bad debts among states if the books and records of the seller claiming the bad debt can support such allocation.
If a seller's amount of bad debt exceeds the amount of taxable sales for the period during which the bad debt is written off, the seller may obtain a credit or refund of tax on any amount of bad debt as provided in chapter
10-59
. However, a credit or refund under this paragraph may not include interest.
If a seller's filing responsibilities have been assumed by a certified service provider as defined in §
10-45C-1
, the service provider may claim, on behalf of the seller, any bad debt allowance provided by this section. The service provider shall credit or refund the full amount of any bad debt allowance or refund received to the seller.

Personal liability of officers, managers, or partners of entity failing to file returns or pay tax--Security in lieu of liability--Bonded municipal officials exempt.
If a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability limited partnership subject to tax under this chapter fails for any reason to file the required returns or to pay the tax due, any of the corporate officers, member-managers or managers of limited liability companies, or partners of partnerships that control, supervise, or are charged with the responsibility of filing the returns or remitting tax payments shall be personally liable for the failure. The dissolution of a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability limited partnership does not discharge an officer, member-manager, manager, or partner's liability for a prior failure of the corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability limited partnership to file a return or remit the tax due. The sum due for such a liability may be assessed and collected as provided by law.
If the corporate officers, limited liability company member-managers or managers, or partners elect not to be personally liable for the failure to file the required returns or to pay the tax due, the corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability limited partnership shall provide the Department of Revenue with a surety bond or certificate of deposit as security for payment of any tax that may become due. The bond or certificate of deposit provided for in this section shall be in an amount equal to the estimated annual gross receipts multiplied by the applicable sales or excise tax rate. This section does not apply to elected or appointed officials of a municipality if bonded pursuant to §§
9-14-6
and
9-14-6.1

Exemption certificate--Responsibilities of purchaser--Violation as misdemeanor--Retention of certificate--Rules and forms.
A seller, who possesses an exemption certificate from a purchaser of tangible personal property, any product transferred electronically, or services that indicates the items or services being purchased are exempt, may rely on the exemption certificate and not charge sales tax to the provider of the exemption certificate until the provider of the exemption certificate gives notice that the items or services being purchased are no longer exempt by filing a new exemption certificate with the seller.
The exemption certificate shall be signed by the purchaser. The exemption certificate shall provide the purchaser's name, address, and valid state tax license number, if applicable. However, any person filing an electronic exemption certificate is not required to sign the exemption certificate.
The purchaser claiming the protection of an exemption certificate is responsible for assuring that the goods and services delivered thereafter are of a type covered by the exemption certificate. A seller of property, any product transferred electronically, or services which are generally described under the exemption certificate is not responsible for the collection of the tax unless otherwise directed by the purchaser.
If the purchaser later determines there is any tax due and owing, the purchaser shall remit the tax owed by the purchaser to the state. If the purchaser makes an exempt purchase and later determines that the goods or services purchased are not exempt, the purchaser shall report the transaction and pay the use tax on the next filing of the purchaser's return.
Any purchaser who knowingly files an exemption certificate with a retailer in order to purchase tangible personal property, any product transferred electronically, or services with the intent to evade payment of the tax, and fails to timely report the same with the department is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. The secretary of revenue may assess a penalty of up to fifty percent of the tax owed, in addition to the tax owed. No interest may be charged on the penalty.
The seller shall retain the exemption certificate for a period of three years from the date it is filed by the purchaser and provide the exemption certificate to the department upon request.
The secretary may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter
1-26
to adopt forms for exemption certificates.

Allowable deductions for auctioneers.
In determining the amount of tax due under this chapter, auctioneers may deduct from gross receipts amounts which represent direct expense charges for clients for tangible personal property, any product transferred electronically, or services purchased by the auctioneer on behalf of a client. However, the sale of the property or service to the auctioneer is not a sale for resale if this deduction is taken. This deduction may only be taken if the amount to be deducted represents an expense specifically incurred for a particular client and the amount is itemized and paid from the client's auction proceeds by the auctioneer or closing agent. The deduction shall be disallowed if the auctioneer receives any profit or remuneration directly or indirectly from the client's expense.

Seller and third party liability.
A certified service provider is the agent of a seller, with whom the certified service provider has contracted, for the collection and remittance of sales and use taxes. As the seller's agent, the certified service provider is liable for sales and use tax due each member state on all sales transactions it processes for the seller except as set out in this section.
A seller that contracts with a certified service provider is not liable to the state for sales or use tax due on transactions processed by the certified service provider unless the seller misrepresented the type of items it sells or committed fraud. In the absence of probable cause to believe that the seller has committed fraud or made a material misrepresentation, the seller is not subject to audit on the transactions processed by the certified service provider. A seller is subject to audit for transactions not processed by the certified service provider. The member states acting jointly may perform a system check of the seller and review the seller's procedures to determine if the certified service provider's system is functioning properly and the extent to which the seller's transactions are being processed by the certified service provider.
A person that provides a certified automated system is responsible for the proper functioning of that system and is liable to the state for underpayments of tax attributable to errors in the functioning of the certified automated system. A seller that uses a certified automated system remains responsible and is liable to the state for reporting and remitting tax.
A seller that has a proprietary system for determining the amount of tax due on transactions and has signed an agreement establishing a performance standard for that system is liable for the failure of the system to meet the performance standard.

If a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability limited partnership subject to tax under this chapter fails for any reason to file the required returns or to pay the tax due, any of the corporate officers, member-managers or managers of limited liability companies, or partners of partnerships that control, supervise, or are charged with the responsibility of filing the returns or remitting tax payments shall be personally liable for the failure. The dissolution of a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability limited partnership does not discharge an officer, member-manager, manager, or partner's liability for a prior failure of the corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability limited partnership to file a return or remit the tax due. The sum due for such a liability may be assessed and collected as provided by law.
If the corporate officers, limited liability company member-managers or managers, or partners elect not to be personally liable for the failure to file the required returns or to pay the tax due, the corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability limited partnership shall provide the Department of Revenue with a surety bond or certificate of deposit as security for payment of any tax that may become due. The bond or certificate of deposit provided for in this section shall be in an amount equal to the estimated annual gross receipts multiplied by the applicable sales or excise tax rate.

Subcontractors--Definition--Certificate issued by prime contractor--Tax liability--Misuse of certificate--Government entities not to issue certificates.
For the purpose of this chapter, a subcontractor is a person contracting with a prime contractor to perform all or part of a realty improvement the prime contractor has contracted to perform. For highway construction projects, a subcontractor includes any person contracting with a prime contractor to perform any of the following services as part of the project: traffic control, striping, flagging, operation of pilot cars, signing, landscaping, seeding, sodding, mulching, and erosion control. A prime contractor shall issue a certificate to a subcontractor showing the prime contractor's valid contractors' excise tax license number. The form shall be prescribed by the secretary of revenue. Any subcontractor who fails to retain a certificate and a record of project designations is considered a prime contractor and is subject to tax under this chapter. Any person not a prime contractor who provides a certificate is liable for tax equal to the amount of tax the person accepting the certificate would have been liable for if the certificate had not been issued. The tax is due at the time the person accepting the certificate would have been required to pay the tax. In addition to any tax or interest due, persons who are not prime contractors providing certificates are liable for a penalty of ten percent of the tax. The United States, the State of South Dakota, or any other state or public or municipal corporation in this state may not issue a certificate.

Prime contractor--Definition.
For the purpose of this chapter, a prime contractor is a person entering into a realty improvement contract or a contract for construction services as enumerated in division c of the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1987, as prepared by the Statistical Policy Division of the Office of Management and Budget, Office of the President, with the United States and its instrumentalities, the State of South Dakota and its subdivisions, or any other state or public corporation, or person as defined in §
10-45-1
. If a contractor engages in services not specifically listed in division c of the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1987, then the services must entail the construction, building, installation, or repair of a fixture to realty before the gross receipts are subject to the tax imposed by §
10-46A-1
. Operative builders, industry number 1531, as enumerated in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1987, as prepared by the Statistical Policy Division of the Office of Management and Budget, Office of the President, are prime contractors regardless of whether they perform construction work themselves or contract with other contractors. A person who is not primarily in the business of making realty improvements and regularly employs persons for the purpose of repairing, maintaining or making realty improvements for his own use and who repairs, maintains or makes a realty improvement for his own use with his regular employees is not a prime contractor and is not liable for the tax herein.

Personal liability of officers, managers, or partners of entity failing to file returns or pay tax--Security in lieu of liability--Bonded municipal officials exempt.
If a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability limited partnership subject to tax under this chapter fails for any reason to file the required returns or to pay the tax due, any of the corporate officers, member-managers or managers of limited liability companies, or partners of partnerships that control, supervise, or are charged with the responsibility of filing the returns or remitting tax payments shall be personally liable for the failure. The dissolution of a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability limited partnership does not discharge an officer, member-manager, manager, or partner's liability for a prior failure of the corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability limited partnership to file a return or remit the tax due. The sum due for such a liability may be assessed and collected as provided by law.
If the corporate officers, limited liability company member-managers or managers, or partners elect not to be personally liable for the failure to file the required returns or to pay the tax due, the corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability limited partnership shall provide the Department of Revenue with a surety bond or certificate of deposit as security for payment of any tax that may become due. The bond or certificate of deposit provided for in this section shall be in an amount equal to the estimated annual gross receipts multiplied by the applicable sales or excise tax rate. This section does not apply to elected or appointed officials of a municipality if bonded pursuant to §§
9-14-6
and
9-14-6.1

Notice of intent to audit defined.
For the purposes of this chapter, "notice of intent to audit," is any notice mailed to any taxpayer indicating that an auditor intends to perform an audit of the books and records of or, concerning a taxpayer, to determine whether the proper amount of tax, penalty or interest has been paid. The notice indicates the type of tax which is the subject of the audit and the date of commencement of the audit. The notice also contains the statement "All records, books, and documents must be prepared for presentation to the auditor on the date of commencement of the audit. All documents evidencing reduction, deduction or exemption of tax not prepared for presentation within sixty days of the date of commencement of the audit need not be considered by the auditor."

Certificate of assessment defined.
For the purposes of this chapter, the term, certificate of assessment, means any certificate issued by the secretary indicating tax, penalty, or interest due. The certificate indicates the type of tax due, the amount of tax due, and the period of time covered by the assessment. The certificate also contains a short statement of the reasons for the assessment. The secretary shall use his or her best judgment in preparing the certificate, but error in the certificate does not relieve a taxpayer of liability for tax, penalty, or interest due under the laws of this state.

Penalty for failure to file return--Penalty reduced or eliminated--Interest charged for late payment--Interest tolled during appeal--Maximum interest rate for mistake of law.
Any person required to file returns or reports under the chapters set out in §
10-59-1
, who fails to file a return or report which includes all taxable transactions within thirty days following the month the return or report is due is subject to an additional amount, assessed as a penalty, equal to ten percent of the tax or ten dollars whichever is greater. However, for reasonable cause shown, the secretary may reduce or eliminate such penalty.
Any person subject to tax under the chapters set out in §
10-59-1
who fails to pay the tax within the time prescribed is subject to an interest charge for each month or part thereof for which the payment is late, which interest shall be one percent or five dollars whichever is greater for the first month, and one percent per month thereafter. If the failure to pay tax was with the intent to intentionally avoid or delay the payment of tax, the person who fails to pay the tax within the time prescribed is subject to an interest charge for each month or part thereof for which the payment is late, which interest shall be one and one-half percent or five dollars, whichever is greater. Interest is tolled during any appeal taken by the department or during any period the hearing examiner extends the time in which to submit a proposed decision or during any period the secretary fails to rule within thirty days after receiving the proposed decision.
Penalty and interest are considered the same as tax for the purposes of collection and enforcement including liens, distress warrants, and criminal violations. Any payment received for taxes, penalty, or interest is applied first to tax, beginning with the oldest delinquency, then to interest and then to penalty.
The secretary may, upon application of the taxpayer, establish a maximum interest rate of twenty-four percent upon delinquent taxes if the secretary determines that the delinquent payment was caused by a mistake of law and was not caused by an intent to evade the tax.

The certificate of assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct. Any taxpayer against whom an assessment is made shall either pay the amount of the assessment or make arrangements agreeable to the secretary to pay the assessment plus additional interest required by §

Hearing--Request in writing--Court jurisdiction--Amended or additional statements of fact--Payment and appeal.
Any taxpayer against whom a certificate of assessment is issued may in writing request a hearing before the secretary if the taxpayer believes that the assessment is based upon a mistake of fact or an error of law. The written request for hearing must be received by the secretary within sixty days from the date the certificate of assessment was mailed to the taxpayer by certified mail, and must contain a statement indicating the portion of the assessment being contested and the mistake of fact or error of law the taxpayer believes resulted in an invalid assessment. If the written request for hearing is not received by the secretary within sixty days from the date the certificate of assessment was mailed to the taxpayer by certified mail, no court has jurisdiction over a suit to contest the certificate of assessment. For purposes of this section, if a written request for hearing is sent by United States mail, the date of the postmark placed by the United States postal service shall be considered the date received by the secretary.
Amended or additional statements of facts or errors of law may be made not less than fourteen days prior to the hearing if the hearing examiner determines such additional or amended statements are in the interest of justice and do not prejudice either party. Hearings are conducted and appeals taken pursuant to the provisions of chapters
1-26
and
1-26
D. A copy of the hearing examiner's proposed decision, and findings of fact and conclusions of law, shall be served on all parties when furnished to the secretary. If the secretary, pursuant to chapter
1-26
D, accepts the proposed decision of the hearing examiner, no court has jurisdiction over an appeal from the final decision of the secretary unless any amount ordered paid by the secretary is paid or a bond is filed to insure payment of such amount. However, if the final decision of the secretary, pursuant to chapter
1-26
D, rejects or modifies the decision of the hearing examiner regarding the amount due on the assessment, an appeal may be taken without payment of the amount ordered to be paid and without filing of a bond. If the secretary's decision is affirmed by the circuit court, no court has jurisdiction over an appeal from the circuit court's decision unless any amount ordered to be paid by the secretary is paid or a bond is filed to insure payment of such amount.

If the secretary finds that the assessment or collection of any tax is jeopardized by delay, he may immediately make an assessment of the estimated tax, penalty, or interest and demand payment from the taxpayer. If the payment is not made, a lien may be filed and a distress warrant issued. The secretary may accept a bond from the taxpayer to satisfy collection until the amount of tax, penalty, or interest legally due is determined and paid.

Any tax, penalty, or interest due from a taxpayer is a lien in favor of the state upon all property and rights to property whether real or personal belonging to the taxpayer. In order to preserve the lien against subsequent mortgages, purchaser, or judgment creditors for value and without actual notice of the lien on any property situated in a county, the secretary may file with the register of deeds of the county a notice of the tax lien in such form as he determines. The priority of the lien shall be determined as of the date the notice of tax lien is received and indexed by the register of deeds. The notice of tax lien shall create a lien in each county where the notice of tax lien is recorded.

The petition shall be verified by the secretary and set forth reasons why the petition should be granted. The petition shall include a certification by the secretary that a license or permit has not been obtained or maintained or has been revoked or cancelled after notice and hearing.

In determining the fair market value of property, the director may not adopt a lower or different standard of value because it is to serve as a basis of taxation. The director may not adopt as a criterion of value the price for which a tract of real property would sell at a forced sale, or in the aggregate with all other tracts of real property in the county. The director shall determine the fair market value by appropriate consideration of the cost approach, the market approach, and the income approach to appraisal. The director shall consider and document all elements of such approaches that are applicable prior to a determination of fair market value.

Agricultural income value--Determination--Database of cropland data.
The secretary of revenue, upon notifying the Agricultural Land Assessment Implementation and Oversight Advisory Task Force, may contract with one or more qualified entities for the purpose of creating or maintaining a database to determine the agricultural income value of agricultural land by county, consisting of eight consecutive years of cropland data and noncropland data. The data for the year representing the highest agricultural income value among the eight years and the year representing the lowest agricultural income value among the eight years shall be discarded from the database and the remaining six years averaged for valuation purposes. For each assessment year, the first year of the eight-year data period shall be the year that is nine years less than the assessment year.
The cropland data must include acres planted, acres harvested, yield per acre, and statewide crop prices. The noncropland data must include cash rents and statewide calf prices. The noncropland data may also include rangeland and pastureland animal unit months per acre, rangeland and pastureland acres, and grazing season data.
Any qualified entity contracting with the secretary of revenue pursuant to this section shall provide the data for each county to the secretary of revenue by June first of each year.
For purposes of this section, a qualified entity is a federal or state agency, instrumentality, institution of higher learning, other federal or state authority, or private entity with expertise in researching or evaluating land production capacity.

Soil classification--Land categorization--Director adjustments.
All soils are divided into classes based on soil classification standards developed by the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service. All agricultural land must be categorized as either cropland or noncropland. Soil types with land capability class I, II, and III must be categorized as cropland and soil types with land capability classes V, VI, VII, and VIII must be categorized as noncropland. Soil types with land capability class IV may be categorized by the director of equalization as either cropland or as noncropland. The director of equalization shall notify the department by November first of each year of any changes to the categorization of the land capability class IV soil types. Beginning with the 2023 assessment year, the total acres of class IV soil types classified as noncropland in a county may increase a maximum of twenty percent over the total acres of class IV soil types classified as noncropland in the county in the previous assessment year. The department shall provide each county with soil ratings for all soil types present in the county. The director of equalization shall implement the soil ratings and utilize the ratings as the basis for determining the value of each soil type in the county.
The director may make an adjustment to a parcel pursuant to §
10-6-131
.
Nothing in this section prohibits the department from categorizing soil types with land capability class I, II or III as noncropland if one or more of the adjustment factors contained in §
10-6-131
affects the productivity of the soil type, and the reasonable, probable use of the soil type that is physically practical, appropriately supported, financially feasible, and that results in the highest sustainable use of the land, is not harvesting crops or plants produced.

The provisions of §§
10-6-145
to
10-6-147
, inclusive, may not be applied to improvements to real property made two or more years prior to the assessment date unless the owner of the real property willfully hid or attempted to hide the improvements from the director for the purpose of evading the taxation of such improvements.

The court shall hold a hearing on such petition and shall determine if the owner of the real property hid or attempted to hide the improvements for the purpose of evading the taxation of such improvements. The court shall provide reasonable notice of the hearing to the director and the owner of such real property. The director and the owner of the real property shall be given opportunity to present evidence and be represented by counsel.

Counties not in compliance--Basis of request for and issuance of certificate of compliance.
Any county not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter may request the secretary of revenue to issue a certificate of compliance if significant changes in market conditions occurred during the previous two years or if the county is in the process of a county-wide reappraisal, at least sixty percent of the properties in the county have been reappraised within the previous three years and the reappraisal is scheduled for completion without undue delay. The secretary may issue a certificate of compliance if he determines that the failure to comply with the standards was through no fault of the assessment practices in the county.

Valuation of certain residential property.
Property classified pursuant to §
10-6-143
shall be valued for taxation purposes in the usual manner. However, the board of county commissioners of the county where the property is located may, in the board's discretion, adopt any formula for assessed value to be used for tax purposes. The formula may include for any or all of the five tax years following the filing of the plat for the subdivision all, any portion or none of the assessed valuation for tax purposes. The assessed valuation during any of the five years may not be less than the assessed valuation of the property in the year preceding the first year of the tax years following the filing of the plat for the subdivision. The board of county commissioners of a county where property classified pursuant to §
10-6-143
is located may, in the board's discretion, if requested by the owner of the property, not apply the discretionary formula and the full assessment shall be made without application of the formula. In waiving the formula for the property of one owner, the board of county commissioners is not prohibited from applying the formula for subsequent property.
